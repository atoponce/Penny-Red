    Logic update to mint_hashcash.py and mode change to verify_hashcash.py
    
    I noticed that I could speed up the minting script by just adding if logic
    to check of there are indeed any mails in the list. If not, move on. Also,
    made a mode change to verify_hashcash.py, so it will actually execute. Heh.

    Updated the CHANGELOG and added RELEASE and RELEASE.asc files
    
    Decided to use 'git log > CHANGELOG' for the changes made and I then
    created RELEASE and RELEASE.asc files for SHA256SUMs and a detached GPG
    signature of the sums using my public key.

    Updated logic to close issues 1 & 4
    
    Updated logic to support the tuple of email addresses for verification. By
    doing so, not only are tokens only checked for those that have been minted
    for the addresses found en EMAILADDR, but any tokens not addressed to said
    recipients aren't checked. Also, got rid of the logic displaying that no
    tokens were found- figured it was unneeded noise.

    Inital commit
    
    Added a sample CONFIG for ~/.muttrc. It's valid .muttrc syntaxt, and can
    be copied and pasted directly into an existing ~/.muttrc.

    Removed old license
    
    When this script was initially created, and I blogged about it, it as
    well as the minting script were licensed under the public domain.
    However, after creating this project on Github, I've changed the
    license to the GPLv3, but forgot to remove the license comment from the
    script. Thus, this commit.

    Added CHANGELOG, LICENSE, mint_hashcash.py and verify_hashcash.py
    
    Chose to use a date timestamp for the version numbers, rather than
    "1.0", "2.0", etc. This way, it is clear when the latest release is
    without checking the webpage for the date.
    
    Also, chose to use the GPLv3 for the license, because Mutt is licensed
    under the GPLv2+ and it didn't make sense to give the project a license
    that allows proprietary redistribution, when the very project it relies
    on does not.
    
    Lastly, the minting and verification Python scripts are inital adds.
